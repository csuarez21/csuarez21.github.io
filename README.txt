Hello! My name is Colin Suarez. I am a recent graduate from Saint Mary’s College of California where I received my M.S. in Business Analytics degree (Cohort 12, Dec 2022). I currently work as an office manager at a chiropractic office but I am actively looking to make the career change into becoming a full-time data analyst because I realized that I’ve always enjoyed looking at data and have had an interest of telling stories through numbers.
